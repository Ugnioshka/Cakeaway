            <div class="statement">
                <p>Our network of talented bakers is selected to ensure each cake is hand-made freshly, from scratch, to
                    order. This is why our cakes are still moist and delicious by the time they are delivered to your
                    door.
                    Further, we can deliver 7 days a week and only need 24-hours notice on most products.
                    We accommodate most dietary requirements and our friendly customer service team is always on-hand to
                    help!

                <p>Cake Away is a virtual bakery, and we do not have a physical shop front (yet). Our orders are
                    fulfilled by our network of independent bakers and bakeries that can meet our strict quality
                    guidelines.
                    We have, over the last few years, built advanced tech to match your order with the best available
                    baker in your area. Further, we've curated a list of cakes on our online shop that we're extremely
                    proud of and developed alongside our network of talented bakers.

            <span class="item-title">How do you ensure quality?</span>
            <div class="statement">
                <p>Firstly, we only on-board bakers that are setup properly to run a baking business. In order for a
                    baker to join our community, we require the baker to have the following:
                    1. Food registration approval with their local council
                    2. The relevant food and hygiene certificate
                    3. A body of previous work demonstrating their skills as a baker
                    Secondly, we set high standards for each of our products, ensuring each baker follows strict
                    guidelines for every cake we list. We document each order and ensure every cake meets our
                    expectations. Please do, however, keep in mind that each cake is hand-made and there can sometimes
                    be slight variation from the product image.
                    Lastly, we take feedback from customers seriously and constantly evaluate baker performance. In the
                    rare instances that we cannot match customer expectation, we immediately try to do everything we can
                    to make it right (please see complaints and feedback below).

            <span class="item-title">What is your policy for cancellations?</span>
            <div class="statement">
                <p>
                    We completely understand that you might have a change in circumstances or a cancellation of the
                    event you are celebrating. However, each baker has limited capacity and by taking on your order,
                    will turn away other business, as well as potentially incurring costs in relation to your order.
                    If you would like to cancel, and give 5 days' notice, we can refund the entire cost of the order,
                    less a £4 administration fee and the baker's reasonable costs incurred to that point.
                    If you could like to cancel within 5 days of delivery we are not obliged to give any refund. If we
                    choose to give a refund or alternatively a store credit, we do so at our sole discretion and reserve
                    the right to deduct the baker's reasonable costs (including opportunity cost from orders turned
                    down) and a £4 administration fee.
                    In the unlikely event that we have to cancel your order for any reason, we will refund the full
                    price to you. We will not be liable for any costs or damages beyond the amount paid for the cake.
